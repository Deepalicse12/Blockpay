Step 1: User (User 1) initiates a payment transaction, either on-demand or through a smart
contract.
Step 2: User's wallet (Crypto Wallet (A)) creates a transaction request, specifying sender
and recipient addresses, and the amount of cryptocurrency.
Step 3: User's wallet signs the transaction request using the user's private key (B),
ensuring transaction legitimacy.
Step 4: User's wallet broadcasts the signed transaction request to the blockchain network
via a peer-to-peer communication protocol.
Step 5: Miners on the network receive the transaction request and validate it by verifying
sender's (User 1) funds, checking the digital signature's validity, and ensuring adherence
to network rules.
Step 6: If the transaction is valid, miners reach consensus on its validity using a consensus
mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.
Step 7: Validated transactions are added to a new block, containing a cryptographic hash
of the previous block and a timestamp.
Step 8: The new block is added to the blockchain ledger, and all network nodes update
their copies of the ledger to reflect the new block.
Step 9: Upon block addition, User 2 receives payment confirmation, ensuring transaction
completion, and the immutability of the blockchain preserves the transaction record's
integrity.
